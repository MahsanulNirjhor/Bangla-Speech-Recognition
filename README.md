# Bangla-Speech-Recognition
This is a project about Speech Recognition on Bengali language using 1d CNN and RNN LSTM. Also various dimension reduction Algorithms are applied like PCA, tSNE etc.

The dataset is collected manually by cutting out desired words from spoken sentences The dataset is represented by spoken Bengali words that we have labeled in English. For now there is just two sets of words and more work is planned on enriching our dataset.
